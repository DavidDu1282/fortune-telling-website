# Actual Diagnosis: Complete GFW Blocking via DPI

## Test Results Analysis

**17CE Test Results:**
- ✅ DNS解析: Success (domain resolves)
- ✅ 连接: Success (TCP connection established)
- ❌ 下载速度: 0.00B/s (ZERO bytes transferred)
- ❌ 文件大小: 0.00B (NO data received)
- ❌ 下载时间: 异常 (Abnormal - nothing downloaded)

## What's Actually Happening

```
User in China
    ↓
DNS Lookup (works) → Gets your IP address
    ↓
TCP Connection (works) → Connects to your server
    ↓
TLS Handshake / HTTP Request (sent successfully)
    ↓
[GFW BLOCKS HERE] → Deep Packet Inspection
    ↓
Response packets DROPPED → 0 bytes received
    ↓
Connection reset or timeout → "异常"
```

### This is Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Blocking

The Great Firewall is:
1. **Allowing** the initial connection
2. **Inspecting** the traffic content
3. **Identifying** something that triggers blocking
4. **Dropping/resetting** all response packets

**Result:** Connection succeeds but no data flows = 0 bytes

## Why DPI Blocking Occurs

The GFW inspected your traffic and found one of these triggers:

### Most Likely Triggers (in order of probability):

#### 1. IP Address Blacklist (Most Likely)
**Your hosting provider's IP range is blacklisted**

Even though connection succeeds, specific IPs are marked for blocking:
- AWS IP ranges (especially EC2)
- Google Cloud Platform IPs
- Certain Heroku/DigitalOcean ranges
- VPS providers commonly used for VPNs

**How to verify:**
```P
# Find your server IP
ping yourdomain.com

# Check if IP is blacklisted
# Use: https://en.greatfire.org/analyzer
# Enter your actual IP address (not domain)
```

**Solution:** Change IP address or use CDN

---

#### 2. TLS/SNI Inspection
**Server Name Indication (SNI) in TLS handshake triggers block**

During HTTPS connection, your domain name is sent in plaintext:
```
Client → Server: "I want to connect to yourdomain.com"
   ↓
  GFW sees "yourdomain.com" in SNI field
   ↓
  GFW checks against domain blocklist
   ↓
  If matched → Drop all packets
```

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Check TLS fingerprint
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 -servername yourdomain.com

# Look for unusual certificate chains or fingerprints
```

**Solution:**
- Use domain fronting (risky)
- Use different domain
- Encrypted SNI (eSNI) - not widely supported

---

#### 3. HTTP Response Headers
**Response headers trigger GFW filters**

Certain headers or header combinations are flagged:
```http
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)  ← OS/version info can trigger
X-Powered-By: Express          ← Framework fingerprinting
Via: 1.1 google                ← Google-related headers
CF-Ray: ...                    ← Cloudflare headers sometimes flagged
```

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Check your response headers
curl -I https://yourdomain.com

# From outside China, should work
# From China proxy, will show 0 bytes
```

**Solution:** Strip identifying headers

---

#### 4. Content-Based Filtering
**Initial response content triggers keyword blocking**

Less likely for your site, but GFW scans for:
- Banned keywords in Chinese
- Certain HTML patterns
- JavaScript libraries known to be used by blocked services

**Your case:** Unlikely since your content is fortune-telling (not political)

---

#### 5. Domain Blacklist
**Your domain itself is on the blocklist**

Could happen if:
- Domain previously used for banned content
- Domain similar to banned domain
- Domain reported by users
- Domain accidentally flagged

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Test with subdomain
# If subdomain works but main domain doesn't → Domain blacklisted
# If both blocked → IP/infrastructure issue

# Create test subdomain: test.yourdomain.com
# Point to same IP
# Run 17CE test on subdomain
```

**Solution:** Use different domain or subdomain

---

## Diagnostic Steps - Do These NOW

### Step 1: Identify Your Hosting Details

**Find your current setup:**

```bash
# 1. Get your server IP
ping yourdomain.com
# Or: nslookup yourdomain.com

# 2. Identify hosting provider
whois YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
# Look for "OrgName" or "descr"

# 3. Check if using CDN
dig yourdomain.com
# Look for CNAME records (Cloudflare, etc.)
```

**Document:**
- IP Address: _______________
- Hosting Provider: _______________
- Using CDN: Yes/No _______________
- CDN Provider (if yes): _______________

### Step 2: Test Different Endpoints

**Run 17CE tests on:**

1. **Main domain:** `https://yourdomain.com`
2. **www subdomain:** `https://www.yourdomain.com`
3. **New test subdomain:** `https://test.yourdomain.com` (create if needed)
4. **Direct IP:** `https://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS`
5. **Backend API:** `https://your-backend-domain.com`

**Compare results:**
```
Main domain:     0 bytes → Blocked
www:             0 bytes → Also blocked
test subdomain:  ? bytes → Check result
Direct IP:       ? bytes → Check result
Backend:         ? bytes → Check result
```

**This tells us:**
- If all blocked → IP-level blocking
- If only main domain blocked → Domain-specific blocking
- If backend also blocked → Separate backend block

### Step 3: Test from Multiple China Locations

**Use 17CE with detailed locations:**

Test from:
- 北京电信 (Beijing Telecom)
- 上海联通 (Shanghai Unicom)
- 广东移动 (Guangdong Mobile)
- 香港 (Hong Kong) - if available

**Compare:**
```
Beijing:    0 bytes → Blocked
Shanghai:   0 bytes → Blocked
Guangdong:  0 bytes → Blocked
Hong Kong:  X bytes → May work (HK has different rules)
```

**If Hong Kong works but mainland doesn't:** Confirms GFW blocking

### Step 4: Check TLS Certificate

```bash
# Get certificate details
echo | openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text

# Check:
# 1. Issuer (CA)
issuer=C = US, O = Let's Encrypt, CN = R3

# 2. Subject Alternative Name
DNS:yourdomain.com, DNS:www.yourdomain.com

# 3. Validity period
Not Before: ...
Not After: ...

# 4. Signature algorithm
Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
```

**Red flags:**
- Certificate from obscure CA
- Self-signed certificate
- Expired certificate
- Mismatched domain names

### Step 5: Test HTTP vs HTTPS

**Important test:**

```bash
# Test HTTP (if available)
curl -I http://yourdomain.com

# Test HTTPS
curl -I https://yourdomain.com

# From China proxy or 17CE:
# Run test on both HTTP and HTTPS
```

**Results interpretation:**
```
HTTP works, HTTPS blocked → TLS/SNI blocking
Both blocked → IP/domain blocking
Neither work → Complete block
```

## Immediate Solutions (Based on Diagnosis)

### Solution A: Change Server IP (If IP is Blacklisted)

**Fastest fix if hosting provider allows:**

```bash
# Option 1: Request new IP from hosting provider
Contact support → Request IP change → Wait 24-48hrs

# Option 2: Migrate to new server with different IP
Setup new server → Deploy site → Update DNS

# Option 3: Add IPv6 (often not blocked)
Enable IPv6 on server → Add AAAA DNS record
```

**Steps:**
1. Contact your hosting provider
2. Request new IP address (explain "IP blocked in China")
3. Update DNS A record
4. Wait for propagation (24-48 hours)
5. Test again with 17CE

**Success rate:** 60-70% (new IP might also get blocked later)

---

### Solution B: Use CDN Immediately (Recommended)

**CDN masks your origin IP:**

#### Option B1: Cloudflare (Free, 2 hours setup)

```bash
Steps:
1. Sign up: https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up
2. Add your site
3. Cloudflare gives you nameservers:
   - NS: lily.ns.cloudflare.com
   - NS: zod.ns.cloudflare.com
4. Go to your domain registrar
5. Update nameservers to Cloudflare's
6. Wait 24 hours for propagation
7. Test from China

Settings to enable in Cloudflare:
- SSL/TLS: Full
- Always Use HTTPS: ON
- Auto Minify: ON (JS, CSS, HTML)
- Brotli: ON
- HTTP/3 (QUIC): ON
- Security Level: Medium (not High - can block China)
```

**Pros:**
- Free tier available
- Fast setup
- Hides origin IP
- May bypass IP blocking

**Cons:**
- Cloudflare itself sometimes blocked in China
- Not as good as China-specific CDN
- Still need ICP for best results

**Success rate:** 40-60% (Cloudflare has mixed results in China)

---

#### Option B2: Alibaba Cloud CDN (Better for China)

**If you're serious about China access:**

```bash
Steps:
1. Register: https://www.alibabacloud.com/
2. Activate CDN service
3. Add domain acceleration:
   - Origin: yourdomain.com
   - CDN domain: cdn.yourdomain.com (or use main domain)
4. Configure:
   - Origin Server: Your current IP
   - Back-to-origin host: yourdomain.com
5. Get CNAME from Alibaba
6. Update DNS:
   - A record: Delete or keep as backup
   - CNAME: Point to Alibaba CDN
7. Wait for DNS propagation
8. Test from China

Important:
- Need to start ICP filing process
- Can use CDN before ICP approved (limited features)
- After ICP approved, full acceleration in China
```

**Pros:**
- Best performance in China
- Works reliably with GFW
- Professional solution

**Cons:**
- Need ICP license for full features
- Costs money (but cheap: ~$20-50/month)
- More complex setup

**Success rate:** 95%+ (with ICP license)

---

### Solution C: Domain Fronting (Advanced, Use with Caution)

**Use a non-blocked domain to front your requests:**

**How it works:**
```
1. Register new clean domain: example2.com
2. Point to same server as yourdomain.com
3. Test if example2.com works in China
4. If yes:
   - Use example2.com as main domain
   - Or use domain fronting technique
```

**WARNING:**
- This is cat-and-mouse with GFW
- New domain might get blocked too
- Not a long-term solution

**Success rate:** 30-40% and temporary

---

### Solution D: Setup Reverse Proxy in China (Most Reliable)

**Deploy a proxy server in China that forwards to your origin:**

**Architecture:**
```
User in China
    ↓
China Proxy Server (Alibaba Cloud ECS)
    ↓
Your Original Server (International)
```

**Setup steps:**

1. **Get server in China:**
```bash
# Alibaba Cloud ECS (cheapest)
- Region: China (Hangzhou) or (Beijing)
- Instance: 1 core, 1GB RAM (enough for proxy)
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Cost: ~$5-10/month
```

2. **Install Nginx:**
```bash
ssh into China server

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Configure Nginx as reverse proxy
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy
```

3. **Nginx configuration:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name chinaproxy.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name chinaproxy.yourdomain.com;

    # SSL certificate (get with certbot)
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/chinaproxy.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/chinaproxy.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    # Proxy to your original server
    location / {
        proxy_pass https://yourdomain.com;
        proxy_set_header Host yourdomain.com;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Timeouts
        proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
        proxy_send_timeout 60s;
        proxy_read_timeout 60s;

        # Buffering
        proxy_buffering on;
        proxy_buffer_size 4k;
        proxy_buffers 8 4k;
    }

    # Hide server identity
    server_tokens off;
    more_clear_headers Server;
    more_clear_headers X-Powered-By;
}
```

4. **Get SSL certificate:**
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d chinaproxy.yourdomain.com
```

5. **Enable and start:**
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

6. **Update DNS for China users:**
```bash
# Use geo-routing DNS (Cloudflare, Route53)
# For China: chinaproxy.yourdomain.com (points to China ECS)
# For others: yourdomain.com (points to original server)
```

**Pros:**
- Very reliable
- Full control
- Good performance
- Bypasses GFW effectively

**Cons:**
- Need to maintain China server
- Still need ICP for domain
- Monthly server costs
- More complex

**Success rate:** 90%+ (even without ICP, works better)
